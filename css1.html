	<h1>Welcome to Kozhikode</h1>
	<p>Northern Kerala's largest city, Kozhikode (still widely known as Calicut), has been a prosperous trading town since at least the 14th century and was once the capital of the formidable Zamorin dynasty. Vasco da Gama first landed at Kappad, 15km north of the city, in 1498, on his way to snatch a share of the subcontinent for king and country (Portugal that is) â€“ though the Zamorins resisted and remained independent until Tipu Sultan's army invaded in the 1760s, with the city then falling under British control in 1792.
